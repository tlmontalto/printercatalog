## What's it for?

The purpose of the Filament Catalog is to keep track of the filament supply in my workshop, and allow me to log the correct setting for each individual filament, to save time on testing in the future.

## Approach

The approach is fairly straightforward, there are a sign up and log in pages to create an account. There is an index where you can view the collection of filaments. From the index you can get to a filament display page which shows all the details. You can also edit filaments, and add new ones, of course.

## Future Fixes

In the future, I'd like to implement Bootstrap to allow for easier style manipulation. I'd also like to have a unique index for each user, so others can use the website for they're own needs.

As far as major changes, I hope to one day have filament as just a subsection of the catalog, and expand it to log/track the rest of my electronics and maker equiptment.

Some of the pages don't transfer well to Safari on iPhone, I think due to the bottom nav bar affecting the positioning of other objects. I would like to look into and solve that problem.

I'd also like to add a filter, where I can sort by color or stock or brand.
